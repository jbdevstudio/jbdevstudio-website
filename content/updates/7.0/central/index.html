<p>	This folder contains composite sites which allow a user to resolve all of a <a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/developer-studio/">Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio</a> Central connector's upstream dependencies via a single URL. Simply launch JBDS, open Central, then select the Software/Update tab to explore this site for installable connectors.

	<p>Content available from JBoss Central has been tested by Red Hat, though support varies depending on the type of content:</p>

	<p>Most content in JBoss Central is hosted (redistributed) by JBoss; however, some connectors cannot be redistributed due to license terms or other constraints, and therefore have been marked accordingly:</p>
