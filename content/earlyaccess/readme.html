<h2 class="prime">Early Access - Read
Me</h2> <br/> <p>JBoss is seeking participants for an early access
program for the Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio 7.0 release. This will offer
users a deeper understanding of the new release. Through their
participation, users will have the opportunity to directly leverage
expertise from JBoss engineering to develop their applications using
the bleeding edge features included in JBoss Developer Studio 7.0. At
the same time, it is an opportunity for the JBoss Developer Studio product
team to gather feedback and input from the participants.</p>

<p>Thank you for expressing your interest in participating in this
program. This document will provide you with all the information you
need to get started.</p>

<h2>Program Structure and Terms</h2>

    <p>The JBoss Developer Studio Early Access program will run as a
    unmanaged program in which any number of users may choose to
    participate.  The program will commence in 

    <!-- START DATE -->
    <b>March 2013</b> 

    and complete by the GA date of the product.</p>

    <p>Although these Early Access releases will not be officially
    supported by Red Hat Global Support team, the JBoss Developer
    Studio product team will directly assist with participant
    questions. At the conclusion of the program, we expect customers
    to use the GA binaries in their ongoing development process. After
    the GA release, any kind of support for Early Access releases will
    cease to exist.</p>

<h2>Early Access Website</h2>

    <p>The Early Access program will include binary installer
    downloads at the above location, and may at some later date also
    include an update site for incremental updates as JBoss Developer
    Studio 7.0 progresses towards its GA Release.</p>

	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      Downloads are available for Linux, Windows and Mac.</p>

<h2>Communication and Support</h2>

      generally available release and our Global Support team (GSS)
      will not be able to support you directly. Please do not file
      support tickets through the customer portal. Instead open a
