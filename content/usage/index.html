<h2 class="prime">Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio Usage Reporting</h2>
<p>Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio now provides a "Usage" plugin which when
installed and enabled will help us gather anonymous statistics about
how the JBoss&nbsp;Tools plugins are being used.</p>
<p>All the data is gathered anonymously and can at any time be disabled
if you wish.</p>
<p><strong>What will we use the data for</strong></p>
<p>With this enabled we can start seeing better how and where JBoss
Developer Studio is being used; we are especially currently interested
in seeing what OS's are being used, what screen resolution and how
often users starts their workspace.</p>
<p>Over time we hope to learn more to help continuously improve JBoss
Developer Studio.</p>
<p><strong>How to enable/disable usage tracking</strong></p>
<p>If you have the plugin installed, then on the first start of this
Eclipse a dialog will pop up asking you to send anonymous usage
statistics.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/please-allow-us-jbds.png"></p>
<p>If you do not want to send anonymous usage statistics, uncheck the
checkbox and press Ok.</p>
<p>If you press Cancel, no usage statistics will be collected but the
dialog will ask again on next startup.</p>
<p>If you just press Ok then usage statistics for JBoss Developer
Studio is enabled.</p>
<p>If you later on decide to not send statistics anymore or want to
enable it, simply goto the Preferences <em>JBoss Tools
&gt;&nbsp;JBoss&nbsp;Usage Reporting </em>Preferences.<strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/preferences-jbds.png"></p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>When the user has enabled reporting anonymous statistics the plugin
uses Google Analytics to track data as though you visited a page under
https://devstudio.jboss.com/usage/.</p>
<p>The information collected is similar/equal to what is possible to
collect when you visit a website, including your IP address, and may be transferred to the United States and other countries.</p>
<p>We do tweak a few things to track more Eclipse oriented things; i.e.
instead of Browser name we use the Eclipse product ID and instead of
Browser version we use the version of the product or if not present the
version of Eclipse core runtime plugin.</p>
<p>We also generate a random id for the installation so multiple
startups from the same eclipse only count as one usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently the only tracking we do is when a workspace starts up with
the plugin installed. We might add more reporting in the future, if so
this page will be updated with details.</p>
<p>If you want to inspect the source code for all of the above it can
be found in GitHub: <a onClick="javascript: _gaq.push(['_trackPageview', '/usage/sourcecode']);" href="https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-base/tree/master/usage">https://github.com/jbosstools/jbosstools-base/tree/master/usage</a></p>
